 Manhattan vacation rental project link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kmaMmO5tmAFA-XCcJX8sXMRiOQTdHNnUPg-_ZbxGVPA/edit?usp=sharing

This project with NYC airbnb data main purpose was made to demonstrate my understanding in cleaning data and using the data to come up with answers for Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
 Also how much money did the top listings generate? To answer the first question about what neighborhood and property size was most attractive I first cleaned the raw data of any data I won't be using.
 and also adding columns of the data that was missing values replacing any empty values with 0. I made a pivot table that shows the neighborhood and the sum number of reviews each neighborhood got per bedroom size.
This pivot table shows that Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem were the top rated neighborhood rentals showing that the best rentals are the 1 to 2 bedrooms.
To answer the second question I found out what the top revenue earned was for each listing by id and found out that the listing with the id of 49946551 was the top earner.
I would recommend investing in property in the Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem since they get the most ratings then anywhere else and to get a listing with 1 or 2 bedrooms.
