Superstore analysis project link: https://public.tableau.com/views/Sprint5project_17447343504280/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

The purpose for this project is to find out what was the main cause of returns and to make a dashboard for monitoring returns. I made a map chart showing the average return rate
 for each state to give a better picture of what state was having the most returns. I also made a dual dot chart to show the amount of total sales of sub-categories to the number of returns.
This helped to show what was being returned the most, I also added a tooltip to show how much money was lost for the total returns of the sub-category.
I also added a bar chart showing the average return rate of each  one of the three categories. This helps to show what product had the most returns. This chart shows that technology had the most.
I also showed a line chart on the dashboard to show the return rate of each month showing the peak and drop points of the return rates by month. I also made a chart showing the number of
returns a person has made. This helps show the two main people that are the cause of most returns for the Superstore. 
A recommendation I made was to find out the reason for Seth Vernon and William Brown returns since they have the highest number of returns. 
This would help us to better understand if it was a product issue or a delivery issue.
