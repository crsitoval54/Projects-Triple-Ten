This project was made to find out what restaurant was the most popular of the year 2020. Also to show what restaurant had the most revenue of 2020, to answer these questions I've made bar charts and a line graph to show the peak and drop points of each restaurant for each year from 2017 to 2020. I made a bar graph of the restaurant's sum of revenue of 2020 and put it in descending order to show what restaurant had the most revenue of 2020 by name. I also added a name filter incase of wanting the check the trends of a specific restaurant. I also made a scatter plot chart to show the restaurants with the most ratings from customers showing who was most popular during 2020. By making these charts on Tableau I found out that though Domino's had the less revenue it was still the most popular keeping its customer engagement up in 2020. I also found out that a restaurant named Kouzina Kafe had the most revenue earned of 2020. I would recommend asking Domino's customers from the year before 2017 if they were satisfied or not with the food or send limited time discounts to them to persuade them to return again since the engagement and revenue dropped in 2020.
