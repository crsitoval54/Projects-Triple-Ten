Dashboard link for Zomato Restaurant Analysis project:https://public.tableau.com/views/finalproject_17459363766640/Dashboard12?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

This project was made to find out what resturant was the most popular of the year 2020. Also to show what restaurant had the most revenue of 2020, to answer these questions Ive made bar charts and a line graph to show the peek and drop points of each resturant for each year from 2017 to 2020. I made a bar graph of the resturants sum of revenue of 2020 and put it in decending order to show what resturant had the most revenue of 2020 by name. I also added a name filter incase of wanting the check the trends of a specific restaurant. I also made a scatter plot chart to show the restaurants with the most ratings from customers showing who was most popular during 2020. By making these charts on Tableau I found out that though Damino's had the less revenue it was still the most popular keeping its customer engagment up in 2020. I also found out that a resturant named Kouzina Kafe had the most revenue earned of 2020.
