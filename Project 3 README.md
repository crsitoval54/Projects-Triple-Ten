The purpose of this project was to help the Superstore from going bankrupt. By doing this I have to find out what products are losing the most money and what are making the most. To do this I made a horizantal bar chart to show what sub-category in what region has geterated the most profit this chart helps to show the two products with the most profit and the two with the most lost. This is helpful for knowing what sub-category should not be sold in what region so that the store can stop selling those products in the regions where they are losing the most money in this case it would be tables in central and south. As for the sub-categories that makes the most profit it would be copiers in the west and east. I also made a other horizantal bar chart to show the total profit of the subcatigories to show the 3 products that should keep being sold and the three that should stop being sold so that profit could not be lost. For example this chart shows that copiers, phones, and accessories were the products with the most profit. The three with the most lost that I recommend getting rid of or stop selling all together would be tables being the highest loss, bookcases and supplies also lossing money.
